## Array

- Fixed-size collection of elements.
- Fast access by index.
- Not dynamically resizable.

## ArrayList

- Dynamically resizable array.
- Provides flexibility in adding and removing elements.
- Slower performance compared to strongly-typed collections.

## List

- Generic list implementation.
- Dynamically resizable.
- Faster performance and lower memory overhead compared to ArrayList.

## Dictionary

- Key-value pair collection.
- Fast lookup by key.
- Useful for quick retrieval of data based on unique keys.

## SortedList

- Key-value pair collection with sorted keys.
- Efficient for maintaining a sorted collection of data.
- Slower insertion and removal compared to Dictionary.

## HashSet

- Unordered collection of unique elements.
- Fast membership checks and element addition.
- Not suitable for maintaining sorted or ordered data.

## Hashtable

- Legacy key-value pair collection (use Dictionary instead if possible).
- Similar to Dictionary but slower performance and lacks type safety.

## Stack

- LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) collection.
- Useful for implementing algorithms with a stack-based approach.

## Queue

- FIFO (First-In-First-Out) collection.
- Useful for implementing algorithms with a queue-based approach.
